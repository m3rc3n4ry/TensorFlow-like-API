# TensorFlow like API
A TensorFlow like API, although very simple, which can perform basic tasks of TensorFlow. This is just an attempt to learn the workings
of Tensorflow by making a "mock API".

### How to run:
Clone or download the repository and run `tf_api_test.py`

You can also put any code in `tf_api_test.py` which you want to try and it will work as long as it conforms to the definitions in `tf_api.py`.
